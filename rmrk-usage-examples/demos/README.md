# Case studies

This section provides examples of RMRK legos in action. In addition, each case study contains instructions on how to set up the smart contracts, how to use them, and a runnable script to take you through them.

If you intend to use the pre-prepared implementations of RMRK legos without many modifications of the Solidity smart contracts, this section is meant for you.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The case studies utilizing **v2.0.0** of our package are coming soon. The current examples are of the previous version.
