# Emotable (ERC-7409)

Emotable RMRK extension that allows users to express their impression of the NFT using Unicode emojis.

We designed and deployed (currently only to test networks) a public good emotable repository, that can be accessed and used by anyone. The emote repository is accessible at the same address on all of the networks it is deployed to.
