# Emotable (ERC-6381)

Emotable RMRK extension that allows users to express their impression of the NFT using Unicode emojis.

We designed and deployed (currently only to test networks) a public good emotable repository, that can be accessed and used by anyone. The emote repository is accessible at the same address on all of the networks it is deployed to.

## ERC-6381: Public Non-Fungible Token Emote Repository

We published an Ethereum Improvement Proposal detailing the specification of the Emotable RMRK extension. If you are interested, you can access it here:
