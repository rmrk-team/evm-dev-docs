# On-Chain Attributes (ERC-7508)

On-Chain Attributes RMRK extension allows for dynamic on-chain storage of token attributes in a public-good repository.

We provide full implementation as well as the interface needed in order to interact with the repository.

{% hint style="info" %}
The ERC-7508 repository is currently only deployed on test networks as main networks deployment awaits the proposal's finalization.
