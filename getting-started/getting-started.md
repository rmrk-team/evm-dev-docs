# Getting started

This section is meant to help give you a head-start with developing your project.

## Development template

We designed a template repository containing all of the configurations and packages required for you to get started:

{% embed url="https://github.com/rmrk-team/evm-template" %}
RMRK EVM development template
{% endembed %}

If you intend to build your project on a `zkSync` network, you can use the `zksync` branch of the template:

{% embed url="https://github.com/rmrk-team/evm-template/tree/zksync" %}
RMRK zkSync EVM development template
{% endembed %}

To use the template, you can use the `Use this template` button:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Use this template button</p></figcaption></figure>

If you wish to use the `zksync` branch,  make sure to use all of the branches of the template by checking the `Include all branches` option:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Include all branches option</p></figcaption></figure>

That's it! You can start building your project using RMRK legos. The repository also includes an example `SimpleEquippable` smart contract that you can deploy and test to get familiar with the toolbox provided within it.
